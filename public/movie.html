<h1>Kim's Personal Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favourite movies.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>A Thousand Words</h3>
<p>
    It's probably one of the most underrated movies. It's both funny and sad at the same time.
</p>

<h3>Predestination</h3>
<p>
    It's pretty good even though it made my head hurt the first time I watched it.

<h3>Wolf Children</h3>
<p>
    I mean come on. A girl fucked a furry? What else can top that except the first 2 I mentioned. Lmao.
